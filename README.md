# Chlorine

    I cannot see anything, it is too cloudy.
    Lets use some chlorine to cleanup that mess and see where our data lies.

Chlorine is a set of SaltStack configurations for hosting services that can replace 'cloud applications' that store your data on someone else's computer.

## Status

The project is already being used and relied on, but some refactoring is
required to make it easily usable for other people.

## Next steps / Todo

* Refactor user-specific configuration into [Pillars](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/pillar/index.html)
* Add XMPP service for IM with Prosody
* Auditing the security of the configuration of the different services
